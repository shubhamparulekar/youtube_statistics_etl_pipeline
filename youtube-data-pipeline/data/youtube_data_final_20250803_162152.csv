JL_grPUnXzY,What is Data Science? | Free Data Science Course | Data Science for Beginners | codebasics,"We will understand what is data science by looking at simple restaurant business example. Data science is a process of getting insights from data. You don't have to be deep learning expert in order to do data science, you can do that in plain old microsoft excel also (if dataset is small enough). In recent years volume of data has grown too much so that data has become BIG DATA. Microsoft excel can't work with big data hence you need tools such as,
